My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
Over the next year, my primary academic goal is to get strong technical skills in cloud computing, security, and scalable system design. I aim to earn relevant AWS certifications to strengthen my profile and improve my ability to deliver reliable infrastructure solutions.
On a personal level, I plan to develop a digital platform that supports verified tourist guidance in Morocco, tackling issues like misinformation and unlicensed operators. I also want to improve my communication skills—especially in English—to confidently share technical ideas, collaborate across borders, and grow my professional network.
By the end of the year, I hope to be in a position where I can apply for international job opportunities or remote roles in cloud security and digital innovation, using my skills to create real-world impact.
